How to run my homework?

For the first exercise, you compile the file with command line (g++ -o ex1 ex1.cpp) and run the file with command ./ex1
After that, you will enter the number for the height of the tree, for example the number "5" and Enter to see the result.

For the second one, you compile the file with command line (g++ -o ex2 ex2.cpp) and run the command for example:  echo "1 2 3 4 5" | ./ex2 with "1 2 3 4 5" is the input of questions which you want see the answers.

For the last one, you compile also the file with command line (g++ -o ex3 ex3.cpp) and run the file with command ./ex3 to get input with the size of vector for example "4" and two vectors. So after Enter, you can see see how the multiplication of two vectors in the output.
